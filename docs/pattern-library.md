# Pattern Library

Fufu Pattern Layer V1 is a source-owned recipe set for basic brochure,
service, and content sites. It lives in this starter so agents can read,
modify, and extend the code directly.

## Rules

- Prefer primitives, then section recipes, then route-local CSS, then new shared
  components.
- Keep recipe props semantic: heading, intro, items, actions, image.
- Keep recipes and CTA groups as Server Components. `TrackedLink` is the small
  client boundary for optional Vercel Analytics events.
- Do not add a generic Sanity page-builder schema for these recipes. Model
  client content semantically, then render through the recipes.
- Do not add Radix, React Aria, CVA, `tailwind-merge`, or styled UI kits by
  default. Add them only when the project has one of the concrete needs listed
  in Optional Libraries.

## Shared Types

Shared recipe types live in `src/components/sections/types`.

```ts
type PatternHref = LinkProps<string>["href"] | string;

type PatternAction = {
  label: React.ReactNode;
  href: PatternHref;
  variant?: "primary" | "secondary" | "outline" | "ghost";
  event?: string;
  external?: boolean;
  ariaLabel?: string;
};

type PatternImage = {
  src: ImageProps["src"];
  alt: string;
  sizes?: string;
  priority?: boolean;
  quality?: number;
  placeholder?: ImageProps["placeholder"];
  blurDataURL?: string;
  objectPosition?: string;
};
```

## UI Primitives

- `Button`, `ButtonLink`, and `buttonClasses()` share the same variants and
  sizes.
- `ActionGroup` renders section CTAs and tracks `event` values when present.
  Use `PatternHref` anywhere a reusable component accepts internal typed
  routes, URL objects, hash links, or external URL strings.
- `TrackedLink` is the low-level client bridge for analytics-tracked links.
- `ImageFrame` provides stable `next/image` regions with `landscape`,
  `portrait`, `square`, and `wide` aspect options. `PatternImage` can pass
  through image quality, placeholders, blur data URLs, and object position.

## Folder Taxonomy

- `src/components/ui`: low-level primitives and helpers that are reusable across
  routes and recipes.
- `src/components/sections`: reusable page-section recipes composed from UI
  primitives.
- `src/components/sections/types`: shared recipe prop types.
- `src/components/site`: shared site chrome such as header, footer, and
  header-specific sentinels.
- `src/app/**`: route composition and route-local components that are not
  reusable elsewhere.

## Section Recipes

- All section recipes accept `className?`, `containerClassName?`, and
  `sectionSize?` for project composition. Use these sparingly for layout
  integration; do not add one-off visual prop variants when route-local CSS
  would be clearer.
- `HeroSection`: `eyebrow?`, `heading`, `intro?`, `actions?`, `image?`,
  `layout?: "text" | "split" | "background"`, `tone?`,
  `align?: "left" | "center"`.
- `SplitSection`: `eyebrow?`, `heading`, `intro?`, `body?`, `actions?`,
  `image?`, `imagePosition?: "start" | "end"`, `tone?`.
- `CardGridSection`: `eyebrow?`, `heading`, `intro?`, `items`,
  `columns?: 2 | 3 | 4`, `tone?`. Items support `title`, `body?`, `href?`,
  `actionLabel?`, `external?`, `event?`, `ariaLabel?`, `icon?`, and `image?`.
- `StepsSection`: `eyebrow?`, `heading`, `intro?`, `items`,
  `layout?: "stack" | "grid"`, `tone?`. Items support `title` and `body?`.
- `StatsSection`: `eyebrow?`, `heading?`, `intro?`, `items`, `tone?`. Items
  support `value`, `label`, and `detail?`.
- `FaqSection`: `eyebrow?`, `heading`, `intro?`, `items`, `tone?`. Items
  support `question` and `answer`.
- `CtaSection`: `eyebrow?`, `heading`, `intro?`, `actions?`, `image?`,
  `layout?: "center" | "split" | "background"`,
  `tone?: "feature" | "contrast"`.
- `RichTextSection`: `eyebrow?`, `heading?`, `content`,
  `width?: "sm" | "md" | "lg"`, `tone?`.

## When Not To Use A Recipe

- The design has a one-off composition that is unlikely to repeat.
- The section requires project-specific behavior, such as filtering, auth,
  checkout, or complex state.
- A native element already solves the problem locally with less code.
- The component would need layout-specific prop names like `redButton` or
  `threeColumnHomepageGrid`.

## Headless Library Policy

- Add Radix only for dialog, dropdown, popover, tooltip, select, tabs, menu, or
  focus-trapped overlays.
- Add React Aria only for combobox, date picker, table/grid selection,
  internationalized inputs, or app/dashboard interfaces.
- Keep `lucide-react` as the default icon source for public-site icons.

## Optional Libraries

The starter intentionally ships without a large interaction or styling stack.
Basic sites mostly need semantic HTML, Server Components, `next/image`, CSS
Modules, tokens, forms, links, and a few repeatable section recipes.

Add these libraries only when their specific value is needed:

- Radix: accessible unstyled primitives for custom dialogs, dropdowns, popovers,
  tooltips, selects, tabs, menus, and focus-trapped overlays.
- React Aria: advanced accessible behavior for app-like controls such as
  comboboxes, date pickers, collection/table selection, drag and drop,
  internationalized inputs, and complex keyboard interaction.
- CVA: typed class variant composition when a component has many meaningful
  variants, sizes, states, or compound variants that outgrow simple maps.
- `tailwind-merge`: conflict-safe Tailwind class merging when a project becomes
  Tailwind-class heavy and consumers pass override utilities.
- Styled UI kit: useful for dashboards or admin apps where speed and dense
  widgets matter more than bespoke brand expression.

Do not add these for ordinary brochure sections, static FAQ lists, contact
forms, image/text layouts, card grids, stats, CTA bands, or simple navigation.
